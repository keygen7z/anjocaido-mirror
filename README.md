Who hasn't pirated  Minecraft at some point and stumbled upon this mythical launcher?

The launcher does not download the files because the page it accesses no longer exists.

This repository contains files from https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/, before it got down. Now, the Bucket link redirects to a 404.

So, I have edited a string in the launcher and changed it to the URL of this repository with the necessary files.

It works! But the only problem is the files in the “resources” folder, that even putting them manually doesn't work.

Doing this has no future, I just do it because I like to fix things.
