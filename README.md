Who hasn't pirated  Minecraft at some point and stumbled upon this mythical launcher?

![launcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6ff113-6bd7-465e-b986-a1e5935a7e60)

As the page that it is trying to access no longer exists, the launcher will not download the files.

This repository contains the original files from https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/, before it was taken down.

So, I have edited a string in the launcher and changed it to the URL of this repository with the necessary files. It works!

I also managed to fix the automatic download of resources (basically sounds) by editing a string in minecraft.jar. 
The problem is that even if all the resources are downloaded, the game still has no sound.

If I manage to fix it, I will update it here.

Notice: Doing this has no future, I just do it because I like to fix things.
